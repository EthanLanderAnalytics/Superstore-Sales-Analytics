## Project Overview
This project uses SQL and Power BI to analyze the SuperStore Sales dataset (2011–2014) to identify sales trends, customer insights, and business patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives
- Clean and structure raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency
- Perform SQL queries to calculate key metrics and aggregations
- Visualize trends and insights using Power BI dashboards
  
## Tools Used
- SQL (DBeaver) - data cleaning, queries, aggregations
- Power BI – interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Analysis Performed
- Imported and cleaned data in DBeaver, including fixing date formats and trimming text fields
- Created a clean data view to preserve raw data integrity
- Calculated key metrics, including total sales over time, sales by product category, sales by region, customer acquisition, and average order value
- Built Power BI dashboards to visualize trends and patterns across time, categories, and regions
- Troubleshot cross-filtering issues in Power BI and ensured accurate data presentation

## Key Insights
- Total sales grew consistently from 2011 to 2014
- Office supplies consistently generated the highest revenue, followed by technology and furniture
- Central regions contributed most to sales across countries
- Average order value was $152.84, providing insight into typical customer spending
- Customer acquisition rate could not be calculated over multiple years due to all first orders occurring in 2011

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and structured SQL dataset and queries
- Power BI dashboard highlighting key sales trends and insights
- Documentation summarizing analysis steps, queries, and insights
